# Development for the Raspberry Pi Pico in C/++

I'm interested in learning how to write C/++ for the Pi Pico, but I'm a total newbie and I've no idea what I'm doing.  So, I'm largely using this repo to document the process from start to finish.  I've primarily written this documentation to help me come back to it after a break when I've inevitably forgotten things, but I hope you find it useful to.

#### Please note, I'm *not* a professional programmer or someone who knows what they're doing.  I'm a hobbyist trying to learn new things, and I know I've learned something well enough when I can write something which I *think* explains it vaguely coherently.  This is *not* an authoritative guide.  These resources probably contain bugs, misunderstandings, and probably even outright falsehoods.  If you spot one, please let me know! ####  

# Things in this repo
* [*Setting up the Windows development toolchain for the Raspberry Pi Pico and C/++*](https://github.com/UnfinishedStuff/Pico_C_development/blob/main/Setting_up_the_Windows_toolchain.md).  This explains how to set up the Pico C/++ development toolchain on Windows, including how to set up one-click build-and-uploading via Picoprobe and Microsoft VSCode.  It's a lengthy process which seems to fail frequently at different steps, but I think I've ironed out most of the problems ("It works on *my* machine!").

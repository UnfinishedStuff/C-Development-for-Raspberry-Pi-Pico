### The PiHut Maker Advent Calendar

[ThePiHut made a Pico H advent calendar for Christmas 2022](https://thepihut.com/products/maker-advent-calendar-includes-raspberry-pi-pico-h), with example projects to match the components opened each day in MicroPython.  This was at about the same time I was trying to learn C/++ on the Pico, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to have a mini set of projects: I'd teach myself to translate the MicroPython for each day into C/++, and in that way build up to whatever exciting thing is in the last box of the calendar.  This part of the Repo documents the code I've pulled together for each day.
